# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++)

## 📖 Description
A robust **Bank Management System** built with C++ that demonstrates the practical application of **Functional Programming approach**.
The system provides an efficient way to manage client data through a console interface, with persistent storage using file handling.

##   Key Features
*  Display All Clients: View a formatted list of all registered accounts.
*  Add New Client: Register new users with unique account numbers.
*  Update Client: Modify existing client details dynamically.
*  Delete Client: Remove records safely from the file.
*  Search: Quickly find client information using account numbers.
*  Data Persistence: All data is saved in a `.txt` file, ensuring it isn't lost when the program closes.

##  Technologies & Concepts
* **Language:** C++11 or higher.
* **OOP Principles:** Encapsulation (Classes), Abstraction, and Data Management.
* **STL (Standard Template Library):** Heavy use of `std::vector` for memory management and `std::string`.
* **File I/O:** `fstream` library for reading and writing data.

⚙️ How to Run
   ** Using Visual Studio:
    Clone the repository or download the source code.
    Open the folder as a Local Folder or create a new Console App project and add the files.
    Build (Ctrl + Shift + B) and Run (F5).
    Using Command Line (GCC/G++)

## Learning Outcomes: 
Mastering File Handling (Input/Output operations).
Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Understanding the separation of concerns by using Header (.h) and Implementation (.cpp) files.
